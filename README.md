## Username-Password Authentication with TypeScript and Inquirer

This repository demonstrates a simple username and password authentication program written in TypeScript using the Inquirer library.

### Features

- Prompts user for username and password using Inquirer.
- Implements basic authentication logic with if-else statements.
- Provides a foundation for building more secure authentication systems.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/username-password-auth.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the program:

   ```bash
   node index.ts
   ```

2. Enter your username and password when prompted.

### Functionality

The program prompts the user for a username and password. It then performs a basic check against predefined values (replace with your actual authentication logic). If the credentials match, a success message is displayed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

**Note:** This is a basic example for demonstration purposes. You should implement more secure authentication methods in production environments.
