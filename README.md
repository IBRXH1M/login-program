Simple Username-Password Authentication with TypeScript and Inquirer
This project demonstrates a basic username and password authentication system using TypeScript and the Inquirer library.

Features:

Prompts users for username and password using Inquirer.
Implements a conditional statement for authentication (replace with your actual logic).
Provides success/failure messages based on login attempt.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository.

Install the required dependency:

Bash
npm install inquirer
Use code with caution.
Run the program:

Bash
node index.js
Use code with caution.
How it Works:

The program utilizes Inquirer to prompt the user for a username and password. It then employs an if-else statement to perform a basic authentication check. If the credentials match the predefined values (replace with your actual logic), a success message is displayed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

Note:

This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would implement a more secure authentication mechanism, such as storing passwords securely using hashing and salting techniques.

Further Enhancements:

Integrate with a database for user authentication.
Implement additional security measures for password handling.
Expand the program to include functionalities for registered users.
